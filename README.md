Exercise for Raft Interview Process

Phase 1, Sprint 0 Agenda, 2 weeks (Monday-Friday, Monday-Friday)
Outcomes:
1. Prioritized backlog of features and stories with sizes (including spikes for unknowns)
2. Release plan
2a. Philosophy
2b. Features and stories assigned to sprints
3. Application Architecture
4. Team Standards

A few assumptions that I made when creating this schedule:
 - The Raft team has not worked with this client before, the team will be remote to each other, spread across multiple time zones
 - "Everyone" refers to client team (PO, Stakeholders) and all 7 Raft team members
 -- I know not all conversations will feel relevant to everyone all the time, but I feel it's worth the investment of the whole team in week one to establish a strong foundation for the project by participating in everything
 - Since I don't know exactly how the product vision and roadmap were shared, I have included a review of those in my agenda to ensure it's covered in a way that allows for Q&A with the client
 - The client team is familiar with agile concepts and has worked with a team like ours previously and the product owner (PO) has experience in this role
 - Phase 1 is a medium/large effort, spanning around 3-5 months

My agenda includes rough blocks of time per day, but these are flexible and will adjust each day based on the speed the team completes the outcomes.

Monday, week 1:
1. Team member intros and roles, led by me

Time: 90 min
Attendees: Everyone (client team, Raft team)
Outcome: everyone knows who everyone is on the team

2. Project Overview & Value Story, led by me and PO

Time: 60-90 min
Attendees: Everyone
Outcome: the team understands why we're working on this initiative (Value Story), the client's main goals of the new application and a good understanding of the legacy system that is being revamped

3. Phase 1 Scope, Priorities, Milestones, led by PO, supported by me

Time: 2-3 hours
Attendees: Everyone
Outcome: a list of what the client wants included in phase 1, their priorities of those features and any firm dates the team needs to deliver to

This day will include several longer breaks. This is a big day and requires a lot of focus, so it's best to build in big breaks for people to recharge. We'll also start breaking down work into features if there's a lot of time left in the day 

===================================

2. Breakdown features into stories, led by tech lead, me, PO

Time: As long as it takes, guessing the rest of Tuesday and part of Wednesday
Attendees: PO, Raft Team
Outcome: each feature has sized stories broken down with a rough priority associated to each

===================================

Wednesday, Week 1:
1. Breakdown features into stories (continued, if needed)

Time: 90 min
Attendees: Everyone

Notes:
 - I know this is heavy, but I feel like it's better to propose this and trim it down once I have more information than to assume less is needed and the team feeling confused or like the sprint was a waste of time
 - I believe the most successful teams come from relationship building; it's really important to me that the group has time to get to know each other, being remote adds levels of challenge to that, which is why there is designated time set aside to make sure it gets done. 
 - Happy teams equal productive teams, I will do my best to inject fun, levity and transparent environment while ensuring we're getting shit done, because that's what really matters.
